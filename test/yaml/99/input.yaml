# A collection of bugs and abnormalities found in the yaml parsing.
# These tests are made to pass, they serve as a showcase of the issues.

## Abnormality 1
# Something with @including lists..
# Could also check the caveat about not indenting
# list - under it's parent.
list:
    - A:
        info: A

    - B:
        info: B
SUM:
    @include: |/list/
        # Uncomment this line and it crasches!
        #Add: yes

### Abnormanility 2
nodes:
    @include: a.yaml

nodes2:
    # This works.
    @include: |/nodes/

nodes3:
    # But this does not include anything... Which is not good.
    @include: |/nodes/A/
